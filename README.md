HTML and CSS Demo Website Landing Page

A non-functional landing page for an imaginary website

This is a project designed to hone and showcase some foundational HTML and CSS skills
This project will make heavy use of flexbox and show an understanding of normal flow and flex flow

The Landing page uses some info from a dnd group I run.

I did learn some new concepts, such as border radius. 

Challenges:

I had a lot of trouble finding answers to my questions. If it was a property I knew of it was easy to find of mdn or w3school, but if I was trying to do something more complex like the trouble I had below, I wasnt able to always find the answer.

I wnated to Vertically center the text in the top section with the photo in a was that stretched in the container to the vertical length of the image. I got close by specifying the height and width of the container and the larger font then filled it up but if the veiwport is too narrow it overflows vertically.

I used padding to align each section vertically, but I think it might be better to wrap things in more container for the column flex of the body, specify an overall width, and then let each row flex fill that width. Ill try that next.

FONTS FONTS FREAKING FONTS NONE OF THEM WORK THEY ALL LOK THE SAME AND NONE OF THEM GET THIN
